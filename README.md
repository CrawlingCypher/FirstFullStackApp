# FirstFullStackApp
This is my first take on a full stack CRUD application that follows an MVC pattern. 

## Tech used
I'm using Node.js to set-up all my endpoints with the help of the express framework.
The database I'm using is MongoDB using the their cloud Atlas to store data about fictional Stories.
The ODM I'm using is Mongoose which works really well with javascript as it uses a lot of objects.



### It is still a working progress
